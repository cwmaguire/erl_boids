Erlang Boids

Multiple concurrent Erlang processes send shape objects to a web page
through a Cowboy Websocket. The processes use a heat map to track where they
and other processes are currently drawing themselves. The heat map dissapates
over time to encourage the processes not to try and go backwards. Unfortunately
this allows them to get trapped in corners by other processes. Needs tuning.
